\question When Resistors Play Together.
\begin{parts}
\part
When a resistor with resistance $R_1$ is placed in series with a resis-
tor of resistance $R_2$, prove that the total resistance of the combination is
$R_{tot} = R_1 + R_2$. This needs to be an iron-clad proof, with clear steps and
justifications for each step.

\part
When a resistor with resistance $R_1$ is placed in parallel with a resistor
of resistance $R_2$, prove that the total resistance of the combination is $R_{tot} = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$.
Again, this needs to be an iron-clad proof, with clear steps and
justifications for each step.

\part
You are given a black box with three terminals, labeled Rock (R), Paper
(P), and Scissors (S). You know that the box contains five 100 $\Omega$ resistors
connected in a particular way between these terminals. Upon measuring the
resistances between various terminals, you find the following:
\[
  R_{RP} = 300 \Omega
\]
\[
  R_{PS} = 250 \Omega
\]
\[
  R_{RS} = 150 \Omega
\]
Here, $R_{XY}$ represents the resistance between terminals X and Y when the
third terminal is not connected to anything.
Provide a schematic showing how the five resistors are connected within the
box. Be sure to label the box outputs $R$, $P$, and $S$ as appropriate.

% a) 
\part
We know that $V=IR$ is true, let that be our guiding light. We can say\dots
\[
  V_{total} = IR_{total}
\]
So\dots
\[
  R_{total}=\frac{V_{total}}{I}
\]
By definition:
\[
V_{total}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} V_n
\]
\[
V_{total}=V_1+V_2
\]
But $V=IR$, so naturally\dots
\[
V_{1}=IR_1
\]
\[
V_{2}=IR_2
\]
\[
  R_{total}=\frac{IR_1 + IR_2}{I}
\]
\[
  R_{total}=I\times\frac{R_1 + R_2}{I}
\]
Hence,
\[
  R_{total}=R_1 + R_2 \, \blacksquare
\]

% b)
\part
Once again, $V=IR$, but since these resistors are in parallel, the voltage drop across them are the same, however their current is different.
\[
  V=I_{total}R_{total}
\]
That is to say\dots
\[
  R_{total}=\frac{V}{I_{total}}
\]
Once again, by definition:
\[
I_{total}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} I_n
\]
\[
I_{total}=I_1+I_2
\]
But $I=\frac{V}{R}$, so
\[
  I_1=\frac{V}{R_1}
\]
\[
  I_2=\frac{V}{R_2}
\]
\[
  R_{total}=\frac{V}{\frac{V}{R_1}+\frac{V}{R_2}}
\]
\[
  R_{total}=\frac{V}{V\times(\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2})}
\]
\[
  R_{total}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}}
\]
Now we find a common denominator for this fraction
\[
  R_{total}=\frac{1}{\frac{R_1+R_2}{R_1R_2}}
\]
Hense, 
\[
  R_{total}=\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2} \, \blacksquare
\]
